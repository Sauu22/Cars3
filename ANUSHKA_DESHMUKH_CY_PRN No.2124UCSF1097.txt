Logical Explanation

Line 1: #include <iostream>

- This line tells the compiler to include the iostream library, which allows for input/output operations.

Line 3-6: int main() { ... }

- This is the main function, where the program starts execution.

Line 5-6: int notebooks, pens; float notebookCost, penCost, totalCost;

- Declare variables:
    - notebooks and pens as integers to store the quantity of each supply.
    - notebookCost, penCost, and totalCost as floats to store the cost of each supply and the total cost.

Line 7-10: notebooks = 15; pens = 20; notebookCost = 2.25; penCost = 0.75;

- Initialize variables with values:
    - notebooks = 15
    - pens = 20
    - notebookCost = 2.25
    - penCost = 0.75

Line 11: totalCost = (notebooks * notebookCost) + (pens * penCost);

- Calculate the total cost by multiplying the quantity of each supply with its cost and adding the results.

Line 12: std::cout << "Total cost of supplies: Rs." << totalCost << std::endl;

- Display the total cost of supplies using std::cout.

Line 13: return 0;

- Return an exit status of 0 to indicate the program executed successfully.
 The output of this program will be Rs. 48.75,
